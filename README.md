In the current recruitment process, evaluating a large number of resumes manually is time-consuming and challenging for HR professionals. To address this issue, this project presents a Mini AI Resume Shortlisting System, a web-based application that automatically analyses resumes and assists in candidate shortlisting.


The system uses AI-like rule-based logic and skill matching techniques to evaluate resume content and classify candidates as Selected, Rejected, or Needs Improvement. It also provides improvement suggestions to help students enhance their resumes based on job requirements.


This application is developed using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, ensuring a simple, fast, and user-friendly interface. By automating resume screening, the system helps reduce HR workload while guiding students to improve their resume quality. Although it does not use real machine learning algorithms, the project demonstrates effective AI-inspired decision-making suitable for academic implementation.
